# The Impact of Hispanic Last Names and Identity on Labor Market Outcomes

## Introduction

### Research Questions

- Do Hispanics face discrimination in the labor market?

1. Does having a Hispanic last name affect a person's labor market outcomes?
  
- Audit-studies studied the effect of an ethnic-sounding name on employer discrimination \footnotesize(Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004; Fryer and Levitt 2004)
  
2. What is the effect of identifying as Hispanic on labor market outcomes?

- This is another approach I will use to study discrimination using how a person identifies similar to Akerlof and Kranton (2000) model of identity

\hyperlink{label}{\beamerbutton{I jump to the last slide}}

### Motivation
 
- Native-born White Hispanic men earn 21% less than White men \footnotesize(Duncan and Trejo 2018)

\bigskip

- A substantial portion of the gap is due to educational differences between Hispanics and Whites \footnotesize(Duncan, Hotz, and Trejo 2006; Duncan and Trejo 2018)

\bigskip

- In this chapter, I examine the role of having a Hispanic last name and identifying as Hispanic on labor market outcomes

### Contribution

- Audit-studies investigated the role of ethnic and racial names on employer discrimination \footnotesize(Bertrand and Mullainathan 2004; Fryer and Levitt 2004)

\bigskip

- A drawback to these studies is that they only observe callbacks, but not wages

\bigskip

- I use a method developed by Rubinstein and Brenner (2014) and compare the children of inter-ethnic couples.

\bigskip

- I compare the outcomes of children with a White father-Hispanic mother, and Hispanic father-White mother

\bigskip

- The labor market outcome I am focusing on is log annual earnings

## Data

### I use two data sets for this paper

1. The Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement from 1994 to 2019.

\bigskip

2. The 1970 to 1990 censuses 

### Studying the Effect of Hispanic Ancestry

- I use the CPS for my main analysis.

- The sample includes:

  1. 1970 to 1990 birth cohorts
  
  2. Aged 25 to 40
  
  3. Native born White citizens

- I divide the sample into four groups, depending on the place of birth of parents.

  1. A parent is Hispanic if they were born in a Spanish-speaking country.
  
  2. White if they are native-born

- I do not observe parents' characteristics directly but impute from "synthetic" parents

### Constructing synthetic parents

Following Rubinstein and Brenner (2014), I construct synthetic parents from the 1970-1990 censuses The sample includes:

\bigskip

1. Married couples

\bigskip

2. Whites

\bigskip

3. I assume that parents give birth between the ages of 25 and 40

### Constructing synthetic parents (cont.)

\begin{center}
\begin{figure}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance =2cm]
\node (start) [startstop] {Synthetic Parents: Observed in 1970 to 1990. $25 \leq age \leq 40$};

\node (pro1) [process, below of = start, yshift = -2cm] {Children: Observed between 1994 and 2019. Born between 1970 to 1990 and $25 \leq age \leq 40$};

\draw [arrow] (start) -- (pro1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\label{flowchart1}
\end{figure}
\end{center}

### Defining Hispanics

- I introduce two alternative definitions of Hispanic:

\bigskip

  1. Based on parent's country of birth (ancestry)
  
\bigskip

  2. Based on the self-reported Hispanic identification

\bigskip
  
  - Trejo (2017, 2019) has shown that those who self-identify as Hispanic have worse labor market outcomes

### Distribution of the four groups

## Empirical Model & Results

### Effect of Hispanic Last Name

$$Y_{ist} = {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{1}}}} HW_{ist} + {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{2}}}} WH_{ist} + {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{3}}}} HH_{ist} + X_{ist}^{\prime}\pi + \gamma_{t}+ \lambda{s} + \phi_{ist}$$

- $Y_{ist}$ is the log annual earnings for person $i$ at time $t$

- $HW_{ist}$, $WH_{ist}$ and $HH_{ist}$ are dummy variables for parents' ethnicities.

- $X_{ist}$ is a vector of controls

- $\gamma_{t}$ is time fixed effects

- $\phi_{ist}$ is the error term

- ${\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{1}}}}, {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{2}}}}$ and ${\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{3}}}}$ are the parameters of interest

- They estimate the gaps between the groups and WW

- I restrict the analysis to full-time full year and waged and salaried males

### Last name effect on log annual earnings

\input{tables/tab05-regression.tex}

### Last name effect on log annual earnings

\input{tables/tab05a-regression.tex}

### Last name effect on log annual earnings

\input{tables/tab05b-regression.tex}

### Effect of identifying as Hispanic

\begin{align*}
Y_{ist} &= \beta_{1} HW_{ist} +  \beta_{2} WH_{ist} + \beta_{3} HH_{ist} +\\
& {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{4}}}} WH_{ist} \cdot Hispanic_{ist} + {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{5}}}} HW_{ist}\cdot Hispanic_{ist} +  {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{6}}}} HH_{ist} \cdot Hispanic_{ist}+  \\
&X_{ist}^{\prime}\pi + \gamma_{t} + \lambda{s} + \phi_{ist} 
\end{align*}

Restrict the sample to HW and WH 
Where:

- $Y_{ist}$ is the log hourly earnings for person $i$ at time $t$

- $HW_{ist}$, $WH_{ist}$ and $HH_{ist}$ are dummy variables for parents' ethnicities

- $Hispanic_{ist} = \left\{\begin{array}{r l}1 & \text{if individual identifies as Hispanic}\\0 & \text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.$

### Effect of identifying as Hispanic (cont.)

\begin{align*}
Y_{ist} &= \beta_{0} +  \beta_{1} HW_{ist} +  \beta_{2} WH_{ist} + \beta_{3} HH_{ist} +\\
& {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{4}}}} WH_{ist} \cdot Hispanic_{ist} + {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{5}}}} HW_{ist}\cdot Hispanic_{ist} +  {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{6}}}} HH_{ist} \cdot Hispanic_{ist}+  \\
&X_{ist}^{\prime} + \gamma_{t}+\phi_{ist} 
\end{align*}

- $X_{ist}$ is a vector of controls

- $\gamma_{t}$ is time fixed effects

- $\phi_{ist}$ is the error term

- ${\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{4}}}}, {\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{5}}}}$ and  ${\color{red}{\pmb{\beta_{6}}}}$ estimates the earnings gap of identifying as Hispanic

- I restrict the analysis to full-time full year and waged and salaried males

### Results

### Results

\input{tables/tab06b-regression.tex}

### Conclusion

- I compare the children of inter-ethnic marriages to study the labor market impact of Hispanic last names

- While males born to White father-Hispanic mother earn less than males born to Hispanic father-White mother, this gap is entirely due to the education gap

- I do not find a significant effect of having a Hispanic last name 

- I do find that men that identify as Hispanic earn significantly less than those that do not even when controlling for ancestry and education

# The Effect of Racial and Ethnic Attitudes on Hispanic Identity in the U.S.

### The Role of Identity

- Identity matters in many economic contexts \footnotesize[@grossmanIdentityPoliticsTrade2021]

- Identity could shift public opinions toward trade \footnotesize[@grossmanIdentityPoliticsTrade2021]

- Racial and gender attitudes affect the racial and gender earnings gaps \footnotesize[@charlesPrejudiceWagesEmpirical2008; @charlesEffectsSexismAmerican2018]

- Person’s identity has personal costs/benefits and social costs/benefits that affect economic outcomes \footnotesize[@akerlofEconomicsIdentity2000]

- Thus, it is important to understand if and how ethnic identities are chosen and shaped by society

### The Role of Identity

-   Identity matters in many economic contexts [@akerlofEconomicsIdentity2000]

    - A person's identity contributes to utility and affects decision-making \footnotesize[@akerlofEconomicsIdentity2000]

-   Identity could shift public opinions toward trade \footnotesize[@grossmanIdentityPoliticsTrade2021]

-   Racial and gender attitudes affect the racial and gender earnings gaps \footnotesize[@charlesPrejudiceWagesEmpirical2008; @charlesEffectsSexismAmerican2018]

-   Thus, it is important to understand if and how ethnic identities are chosen and shaped by society

### Research Question

-   How do individual characteristics and social attitudes toward racial and ethnic minorities affect the self-reported identity of Hispanics in the United States?

### Measuring Hispanic Identity

-   In most datasets, ethnicity is self-reported, i.e. *subjective*

-   A more *objective* measure would be based on ancestry, name, etc.

-   Data on objective measures of Hispanic identity is not commonly available

-   I use the *Current Population Surveys*, which report the country of birth of parents

-   Three generations can be identified as young people still living with parents

## Data

### Current Population Survey (CPS)

-   Monthly survey of more than 65,000 households

-   I link household members to each other

-   Starting in 1994, CPS asked about the place of birth of parents

-   This allows me to construct an objective measure of the Hispanic identity of minors under the age of 17 that live with their parents

-   The sample is children 17-year-old and younger living with their parents between 2004 to 2021

img1 <- rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG(file.path("/Users/hhadah/Documents/GiT/my_thesis/presentation/dissertation/figures","diag.png"))), interpolate = FALSE)

grid.arrange(img1)
```

### Implicit Association Test (IAT) as a Measure of Bias {#id}

-   An implicit association test measures how people associate:

    -   Concepts as in dark-skinned people

    -   Evaluations as in good, bad, or stereotypes

-   The innovation of such the test that it could measure the attitudes and beliefs of people that they would be unwilling to report on a survey

-   IAT was shown to be correlated with economic outcomes, voting behavior, and health \footnotesize[@chettyRaceEconomicOpportunity2020; @gloverDiscriminationSelfFulfillingProphecy2017; @friesePredictingVotingBehavior2007; @leitnerRacialBiasAssociated2016; @alsanDoesDiversityMatter2019]

-   I use data from 2004 to 2021

# knitr::include_graphics(normalizePath(file.path(tables_plots_dir,"patched_plots.png")))
```

## Empirical Strategy

### Estimating the Effect of Bias on Subjective Hispanic Identity

I am going to estimate the following effects separately for generation $g \in \{1,2,3\}$

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
H_{ist}^g &= \beta_1^g Bias_{st} +\beta_2^g DadCollegeGrad_{ist}+\beta_3^g MomCollegeGrad_{ist} + \beta_4^g Woman_{ist} \\
           &+ X_{ist}^g\pi + \gamma_{rt} 
           + \varepsilon_{ist}; 
           \text{where } g \in \{1,2,3\}
\end{align*}
```

Where for person $i$ in state $s$ interviewed at year $t$:

-   $H_{ist}^g$ is the subjective Hispanic identity of person from generation $g \in \{1,2,3\}$

-   $Bias_{st}$ is the average bias in state $s$ at year $t$

-   $X_{ist}^p, X_{ist}^s$ are vectors of parental characteristics and controls that include education, parental types, age, and sex

-   $\gamma_{rt}$ is region $\times$ time fixed effects

### Estimating the Effect of Bias on Subjective Hispanic Identity

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
H_{ist}^g &= \beta_1^g Bias_{st} +\beta_2^g DadCollegeGrad_{ist}+\beta_3^g MomCollegeGrad_{ist} + \beta_4^g Woman_{ist} \\
           &+ X_{ist}^g\pi + \gamma_{rt} 
           + \varepsilon_{ist}; 
           \text{where } g \in \{1,2,3\}
\end{align*}
```

The coefficient of interest is

-   $\beta_1^g$ that estimates the effect of bias on the subjective Hispanic identity

### Bias Negatively Affects Identity

-   Attitudes toward ethnic minorities have a significant negative effect on the subjective identity of Hispanics

-   A one-unit increase in bias is associated with a:

    -   14 p.p. decrease in the subjective Hispanic identity of first-generation Hispanic immigrants

    -   23 p.p. decrease in the subjective Hispanic identity of second-generation Hispanic immigrants

-   A one-unit increase in bias is associated with a:

    -   37 p.p. decrease in the subjective Hispanic identity of the second-generation Hispanic immigrants of Hispanic fathers-Hispanic Mothers
