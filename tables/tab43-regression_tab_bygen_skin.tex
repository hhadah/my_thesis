\item[1] \footnotesize{Each column is an estimation of equation (\ref{eq:identity_reg_bias}) by 
                      parents' type with region Ã— year fixed effects with \citet{charlesPrejudiceWagesEmpirical2008} Prejudice  measure. 
                      \citet{charlesPrejudiceWagesEmpirical2008} use the General Security Survey of the most common racial questions between 1970-2000 for their measure of prejudice.
                      To use the prejudice   measure, I take the average of the GSS questions by year groups. The groups I use are as follows:
                      (1) 1977 and 1982, (2) 1985 and 1988, and 1989, (3) 1990, 1991, and 1993, and (4) 1994 and 1996. I link these groups to the following
                      grouped Current Population Survey (CPS) years: (1) 1994-1999, (2) 2000-2005, (3) 2006-2010, and (4) 2011-2016. 
                      In other words, I merge CPS data with the residual prejudice  measure from 20 years before the survey.
                      I include controls for sex, quartic age, parental education.
                      Standard errors are clustered on the state level.}
