\item[1] The data is restricted to people interviewed in 1970 and 1960 and also White and married. I identify the ethnicity of a person through their place of birth. A parent is Hispanic if they were born in a Spanish-speaking country. A parent is White if they were born in the United States.
\item[2] The table includes information on the proportion of the four types of synthetic parents that I have constructed.
